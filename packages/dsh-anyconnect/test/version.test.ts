 * read ever breaks, version.ts falls back to '0.0.0-dev' and the second test
 * goes red, flagging the regression (and the drift it would cause in heartbeat
 * / CLI output).
 *
 * Unlike the upstream project this package came from, the version is NOT a
 * build-time `define`: this monorepo builds with plain `tsc`, which has no
 * define facility. Reading the manifest at runtime also removes the stale-
 * artifact failure mode a define has — bumping the version after a build can
 * no longer ship artifacts reporting the old one.
